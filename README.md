Just one simple library for jigsaw.

The idea is from **headbreaker** partially, the code depends on **Konva** heavily. Thanks all of themüôè‚òï.

        container: '#container',    //the div to place your jigsaw
        rowCount: 2,    //how many pieces per row in your tigsaw
        columnCount: 2, //how many pieces per column in your tigsaw
        imageSrc: 'puzzle.jpg', //the image uri or url
